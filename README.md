Hooks were introduced in React `v.16.8.0` aiming for replace the `class` Components.  

Main benefits are:
 - reusable logic
 - working only with functional components in entire app

Drawbacks?
- new `API` to learn... _but, hey! This is why we made this course for_ ðŸ˜‰

# Project _Secret Gift Giver_

- logic is nearly the same as from _React Basic_ (with @michaljabi) course on [eduweb.pl](https://eduweb.pl) 
- refreshed with `tailwind css` version of UI
  - using pure `tailwind` solution to not make it overly complicated
  - generic components are located at [components/ui](./src/components/ui)
- we will learn how to use and make `hooks` based on this project, and problems around it.

## How to start:

- remember about `npm install`
- then run fake back-end app: `npm run backend`
- then, front-end with React: `npm run dev`

go to http://localhost:5100/ to see the dev server.
